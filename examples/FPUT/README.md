# FPUT example

In this example, we recover the equations of movement that generate the dynamics of the FPUT example. 
* Data is generated in FPUT_simulation.ipynb
* Data is stored in FPUT_linear.csv and FPUT_non_linear.csv for the two different types of models considered. 
* Data is analyzed in FPUT_graph_discovery.ipynb


>**Note that** it may behave slightly differently from what is presented in the paper. This is due to the fact that the code was entirely re-written in JAX, so computations differ slightly. Please refer to the release CHD-V1.1.0 (or the PIP version 1.1.0 of the code) for the exact code used in the paper
