# Data generation

To generate the data, we use `BCR.bngl` from [Catalyst](https://github.com/SciML/Catalyst_PLOS_COMPBIO_2023). This [BioNetGen](https://bionetgen.org) file specifies a chemical reaction network and integrates it. By varying the initial concentration of reactants, we generate five runs located in the `runs` folder. The Matlab files generated by the BioNetGen files are modified to output concentrations and derivatives of the species at each instant. 

The file `process runs.ipynb` processes these runs to create the different csv files of each run, and a concatenation of these files to get a full dataset, `BCR.csv`. 

We also use the chemical reaction network defined to sample uniformly in [0,1] concentrations, and record the corresponding time derivatives, to get the `BCR_uniform.csv` dataset.
