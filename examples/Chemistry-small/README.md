# Small chemistry example

This example is another simple toy example to test the method. 


>**Note that** it may behave slightly differently from what is presented in the paper. This is due to the fact that the code was entirely re-written in JAX, so computations differ slightly. Please refer to the release CHD-V1.1.0 (or the PIP version 1.1.0 of the code) for the exact code used in the paper
